      -	"Before using this template. Please create a folder named 'lambda-env-vars' and place env.yaml file inside it if single lambda function is being used in the blueprint. For multiple lambda functions, create the file in the following format, ${LambdaPurpose}env.yaml. For different files across environments follow ${LambdaPurpose}${environment}env.yaml, eg: ingestiondevenv.yaml. This is mandatory for SC Lambda product to work from v19.2, since we are using transform function inside the cfn-template. Modify the file contents only if environment variables are required."
